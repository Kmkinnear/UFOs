# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to expand on our UFO tracking website that we created with Dana in the module. However, that website only allowed us to be able to filter our sightings data by "Date". We have now added more search criteria that will allows us to be able to filter by "City", "State", "Country", and "Shape". This will give the user an easier way to drill down into the specific data that they are looking for. 

## Results
*Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
*There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)

We can see in the picture above where we have added the ability for the user to use multiple search criteria to narrow down their sightings search. We have provided examples to how the data format should look depending on which filter they plan on using. For example, we don't want the user entering the full name for a state since the states are represented in our data using their abbreviations. We also don't want the user to enter capitalized state abbreviations since these will not return the search results as the data is now. We've included pictures to show the difference between searching by the full state name vs. the abbreviation.


Search by State Name

Search by State Abbreviation

To activate the filter, the user will simply need to enter their search criteria and then click off to the side of the filter section to filter down the data. This is because we have removed the button feature that we had previously created in the module to initiate the filter. We also added in some additional code to allow the user to initiate the search hit hitting the "Enter" button.
