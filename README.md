# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to expand on our UFO tracking website that we created with Dana in the module. However, that website only allowed us to be able to filter our sightings data by "Date". We have now added more search criteria that will allows us to be able to filter by "City", "State", "Country", and "Shape". This will give the user an easier way to drill down into the specific data that they are looking for. 

## Results

We can see in the picture above of our completed webpage where we have added the ability for the user to use multiple search criteria to narrow down their sightings search. We have provided examples to how the data format should look depending on which filter they plan on using. For example, we don't want the user entering the full name for a state since the states are represented in our data using their abbreviations. We also don't want the user to enter capitalized state abbreviations since these will not return the search results as the data is now. We've included pictures to show the difference between searching by the full state name vs. the abbreviation.

Search by State Name

Search by State Abbreviation

To activate the filter, the user will simply need to enter their search criteria and then click off to the side of the filter section to filter down the data. This is because we have removed the button feature that we had previously created in the module to initiate the filter. We also added in some additional code to allow the user to initiate the search hit hitting the "Enter" button.

## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One drawback of using this new design is that we removed the "Filter" button which may confuse some users that have not used the page before. A button is a clean way to have the user filter the data without leaving them to try and figure out how to initiate the filter. In our current design, we are unly able to filter it by clicking in the webpage or having the user click the "Enter" key. There's also no instructions for the user how to initiate the filter so they are left trying to figure it out on their own. 

One recommendation that I have to improve the site is going back to using a "Filter" button to eliminate the guesswork for the user of how to initiate the filter. This would allow for a simplified approach for how to get your filtered data on the webpage. Another recommendation that I have is to put an instructional note on the webpage with how to run the filter function on the website. That would allow the user to know that they would need to enter the search criteria and either click outside the filter area or press the "Enter" key to filter the data.
